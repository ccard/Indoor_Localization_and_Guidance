================================

#Description
This repository contains the mobel program for my thesis on *"Indoor Markerless Localization and Guidance for the Mobile Environment"*.  It uses the open source libraries for *OpenCV* and *Android SDK*

#Setup and Installation
##Required Libraries
 - [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html): Free and opensource Android development tools.
 - OpenCV libraries for Android: This is the Android and java versions of Opencv and contains most functionality of OpenCV.  I recomend downloading it from NVIDA's Developer site and its called [Tegra Android Development Pack](https://developer.nvidia.com/tegra-resources) for using Opencv with android. It also contains the Android SDK's and several other helpful tools that you can choose to install if you wish. There is also another open source Opencv Library for java and android that can be [downloaded](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-android/2.4.4/) but i recomend the one from NVIDA.
 - IDE: you can use [eclispe](https://www.eclipse.org/) to develope this application but I am using and recomend [Intellij](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
